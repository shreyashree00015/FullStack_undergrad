                    <strong>Full Stack Web Development:</strong><br>
                    I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end web development, enabling me to create robust and interactive web applications. This included mastering technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries for building dynamic user interfaces and server-side functionalities.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong><br>
                    I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and computational efficiency through studying various data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs) and algorithms (including sorting, searching, and optimization techniques). This knowledge is crucial for designing efficient and scalable software solutions.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Operating Systems:</strong><br>
                    This subject deepened my understanding of the core principles and functions of operating systems, including process management, memory management, file systems, and system calls. It provided me with insights into how operating systems interact with hardware and software to manage resources and ensure smooth operation.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong><br>
                    My specialization in AI allowed me to explore cutting-edge concepts and techniques in the field. This included:
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Machine Learning:</strong><br>
                    I learned about various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks. I gained experience in applying these algorithms to real-world problems and datasets.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Deep Learning:</strong><br>
                    I delved into advanced neural network architectures and techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to tackle complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong><br>
                    This area focused on enabling machines to understand and interact with human language. I explored techniques for text analysis, sentiment analysis, language modeling, and machine translation.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong><br>
